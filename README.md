## Usage

As a visitor you can browse the store (main button on top of the screen), and sort packages by name or language.

As a registered user (follow the link in upper-right corner):
1. you can give feedback on any published package (through the button "new feedback" on every package page);
2. you can publish pages for new packages, whether you are the author or not.

A banner image can be uploaded when sending a new package. This image will be included in the carousel on welcome page.
