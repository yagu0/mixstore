Sure :
 - translations
 - add defensive checks at many places to avoid ugly error screens (duplicate key, ...etc)
 - (re)factor some controllers code

Maybe :
 - redirect after page access http://knplabs.com/blog/2012/01/13/redirect-after-registration-in-symfony2/
 - move assets to bundles instead of web/mixstore
